Question 1. Create a Java simulator for WordCount.
Create a WordCount class. You should be able to specify the number of Input-splits (the same as the number of Mappers) and the number of reducers.
You have already created the Mapper class. (See W1D1)
You have already created the Reducer class. (See W1D2)

WordCount  class has m Mappers, where m is the number of Mappers and has r Reducers, where r is the number of reducers.
Mappers will produce their output. Then a method getPartition determines the reducer a specific key-value pair should go. 
For your convenience, see the getPartition method:
	public int getPartition(String key){
		return (int) key.hashCode() % r;
	}
Keep this code inside WordCount class.
Once all values are in the Reducer, Reducer follows the steps outlined in W1D2.
Add necessary output statements so that your output matches one shown in the attached file TestDataOutput.
