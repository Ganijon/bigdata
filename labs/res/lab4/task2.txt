Question 2. Illustrate WordCount In-Mapper Combining Algorithm.
Also assume that there are three input splits:
Input split 0 : [apple lemon mango salmon wheat apple mango] 
Input split 1 : [barley salmon apple orange carrot rice salmon]
Input split 2 : [mango carrot lemon carrot apple rice tuna]
Since there are three input splits, there will be three Mappers. Thus, Input split I is handled by Mapper I (I = 0, 1, 2). Assume that there are three reducers. Note that Mapper I and Reducer I run on the same machine (I = 0, 1, 2). 
Further, let the partitioner  assign all words less than letter ‘k’ to Reducer 0,  all words greater than ‘r’ to Reducer 2 and  everything else to Reducer 1.
