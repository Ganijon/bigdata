Question 2
Define an array to be nice if whenever it contains 4, it also contains 3. 
See examples below:
[7, 6, 2, 3, 1]         //nice
[7, 6, 2, 4, 1]         //NOT nice. 4 is there, but 3 is not there
[3, 6, 2, 3, 4]         //nice
[3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 7, 4]   //nice
[1, 6, 2, 8, 2, 9]      //nice

Explain how map and fold (of functional programming) can be used to determine whether or not an array is nice.
In other words, write pseudo-code for functions f and g, specify initial value and interpretation for final value.
