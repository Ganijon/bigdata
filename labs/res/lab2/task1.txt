W1D2

Question 1
This part of the assignment starts where W1D1 left off. 
Yesterday, you created the Mapper Class. Today,  you are going to create the Reducer Class.

Write a Java program to accomplish the following tasks:
- Create a GroupByPair with two data members. First member is Key. Second member is a list of Values.
- Iterating through the sorted list of Key-Value Pair, create a new list of GroupByPair so that all 
values associated with the same key are grouped together and kept in one GroupByPair.
- Print the GroupByPair list
- Iterate through GroupBy list sum the values and print out (key, sum) pairs.
- Include additional print statements so that the output produced matches the sample output file attached.
Note: 1. Use the test data from W1D1.
Note: 2. Observe that you just simulated word count MapReduce with one Mapper and one Reducer.
