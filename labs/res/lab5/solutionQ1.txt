            H = new AssociativeArray       

        method Map(docid a; doc d)
            for all term w in doc d do
                for all term u in Neighbors(w) do
                    H{(w;u)} = H{(w;u)} + 1

        method Close
            for all pair (w;u) in H do
                Emit((w,u), H{(w;u)})
