Solution Q2: Write an in-mapper combiner algorithm modifying algorithm 3.9 (That is, stripes approach)

    class Mapper
        
        method Initialize
            H = new AssociativeArray
        
        method Map(docid a; doc d)
            for all term w in doc d do
                Hg = new AssociativeArray
                for all term u in Neighbors(w) do
                    Hg{u} = Hg{u} + 1 . //count words co-occurring with w
                H{w} = sum( H{w}, Hg )
        
        method Close
            for all term w in H do
                Emit(term w; stripe H{w})
    
    class Reducer

        method Reduce(term w; stripes [H1;H2;H3; : : :])
            Hf = new AssociativeArray
            for all stripe H in stripes [H1;H2;H3; : : : ] do
                Sum(Hf; H)  //Element-wise sum
            Emit(term w; stripe Hf )
